1. Genre rating trend study:
   - Group by year + genre
   - Calculate avg rating
   - Plot trend lines

2. Director consistency:
   - Map directors via title.crew
   - Compute mean rating per director
   - Rank directors

3. Runtime correlation:
   - scatter plot runtimeMinutes vs avgRating
   - Pearson correlation

4. Budget relation:
   - If external dataset mapped -> regression analysis

5. Country-level:
   - If region mapping -> group by region -> avg rating

6. Critic vs audience:
   - Merge external critic dataset
   - Compare difference distributions

7. Subgenre evolution:
   - explode multi-genres
   - compare primary vs sub genre

8. Votes-volume bias:
   - bucket movies into groups based on numVotes
   - visualize rating distributions for each bucket
